A WordPress plugin for Backblaze b2 cloud to sync assets files from wp-content/uploads onto a Backblaze B2 bucket

## Description ##

This plugin allows you to sync your wp-content/uploads folder onto your backblaze b2 bucket.

It will also automatically sync all your media whenever you:
- create a new post or page and add a new media
- edit an existing post or page to add or update a media file

NOTE:
It will not get triggered if you upload a media on the media library page.
Fortunately, after you upload a media like this, you can directly trigger a sync to backblaze by using the action button that we put at your disposal.

## REQUIREMENTS ##

This plugin relies and assumes that you have *rclone* installed on your server.
Refer to this guide on how to install rclone: [https://rclone.org/downloads/](https://rclone.org/downloads/)

## TODO in next phase ##

- Identify an appropriate **hook** when a media is uploaded via the ***WordPress Media Library*** so that we can trigger the sync for this action as well
- Tell the sync process to ignore certain type of files
- The log file messages are not pretty - create a custom approach for that instead of relying on `monolog/monolog`
- (not a priority for now) Show a real-time verbose mode of the sync when triggering the sync manual using the action button?

## Installation ##

1) Install & activate the plugin

2) Fill in your Backblaze B2 Bucket credentials on the admin page "B2-Sync" menu
